# LazyBrain v1.0.0 🧠

>**"Lazy but Smart"**

This is the initial release of **LazyBrain**, the plugin that connects your local LLMs (Ollama, LM Studio) directly to your Obsidian Vault. It was built completely with AI and good vibes.

## ✨ Features

*   **🖼️ Image Analysis**: Drag and drop images into the chat (multimodal support).
*   **🌿 Branching**: Fork any conversation to explore new ideas without losing your place.

## 🛠️ Fixes & Polish
